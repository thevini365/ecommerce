# Vini's e-commerce
## ecommerce app from cave to scale over 9000!

This is a demo project that I'm building to support "run at Scale".
Evolving an App from Cave project to Scale and beyond! ─=≡Σ((( つ◕ل͜◕)つ


I also want to try out some of my Frankenstein mad-scientist coding ideas. ψ(｀∇´)ψ


### PRODUCT ROADMAP

* Simple Public Online Catalog, listing products openly
* Simple Ecommerce solution (buying items only)
* Inventory Management Module
* Shipping Module
* Grow into a SaaS
* TDB (aka please help me, suggestion are most welcome!)


### TECH ROADMAP

* Spring, Spring everywhere... Due to its popularity and considerable know-how, I will be starting with all things Spring for now.
* Monolith Architecture (Remember it's a single tenant Online Catalog)
* REST APIs
* Multi-tenant App
* Migrate to µService Architecture
* Migrate to graphQL
* Event sourcing architecture

### GOALS

* Practice some fun stuff =P
* Test out some practices that would be difficult in a large codebase/project/org
* HAVE FUN!!! ☜(⌒▽⌒)☞

Cheers!

 PS: Most of the requirements and structure are built on the fly with minimal planning. The goal is to improve along the way.
 
 I do expect some intentional "accidental complexity", e.g. push to prod fast and iterate
